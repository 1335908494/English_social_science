A teacher gives lectures for several reasons. Firstly, lectures require students to acquire information on a topic in a quick and efficient way, which can be a good exercise. Secondly, lectures can offer students one way to know how the subject is viewed by people in their department. Thirdly, lectures can give students chances to meet with other students. Fourthly, lectures can provide an overview of a subject or a particular element of a course. Finally, lectures can stimulate students to further their studies by themselves.
